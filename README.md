Hands-on project for an technical assessment for an Internship Position at Reiz Tech, where I was tasked to build a web application that leverages a [public API](https://restcountries.com/) to display country data such as name, area, and region.

## Getting Started

Rebuild locally using the following commands

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
